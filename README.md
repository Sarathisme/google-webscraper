# Google Web Scraper

## This is a web scraper that takes the queries as input and extracts the results of the google search based on the query. It has two modules: 

  1. The <b>master</b> branch is the GUI implementation of the webscraper
  2. The <b>cli</b> branch is the command line implementation of the webscraper
  
#### BeautifulSoup4 library is used for the web scraping purpose

#### NOTE: For the <b>cli</b> implementation, cmd+click (MacOS) and a click (Ubuntu) is sufficient. For Windows there is such option for accessing links through command line.
